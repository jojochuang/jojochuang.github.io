      <description>Requirements Working docker setup AWS CLI (optional) Ozone in a Single Container The easiest way to start up an all-in-one ozone container is to use the latest docker image from docker hub:
docker run -p 9878:9878 -p 9876:9876 apache/ozone This command will pull down the ozone image from docker hub and start all ozone services in a single container. This container will run the required metadata servers (Ozone Manager, Storage Container Manager) one data node and the S3 compatible REST server (S3 Gateway).</description>

      <description>Requirements Working kubernetes cluster (LoadBalancer, PersistentVolume are not required) kubectl As the apache/ozone docker images are available from the dockerhub the deployment process is very similar to Minikube deployment. The only big difference is that we have dedicated set of k8s files for hosted clusters (for example we can use one datanode per host) Deploy to kubernetes
kubernetes/examples folder of the ozone distribution contains kubernetes deployment resource files for multiple use cases.</description>

      <description>To verify Apache Ozone releases using GPG: Download the release ozone-X.Y.Z-src.tar.gz from a mirror site. Download the signature file ozone-X.Y.Z-src.tar.gz.asc from Apache. Download the Ozone KEYS file. gpg --import KEYS gpg --verify ozone-X.Y.Z-src.tar.gz.asc ozone-X.Y.Z-src.tar.gz To perform a quick check using SHA-512: Download the release ozone-X.Y.Z-src.tar.gz from a mirror site. Download the checksum ozone-X.Y.Z-src.tar.gz.sha512 from Apache. sha512sum -c ozone-X.Y.Z-src.tar.gz Note: Before 1.1.0 release Ozone was part of the Apache Hadoop project.</description>

      <description>What is Ozone? Ozone is an object store designed for big data applications. Big data workloads tend to be very different from standard workloads and Ozone is born out of lessons learned from running Hadoop in thousands of clusters.
Why an Object Store? Object stores are more straightforward to build and use than standard file systems. It is also easier to scale an object store. The fact that most big data applications and frameworks like Apache Spark, YARN and Hive can run both on cloud and on-prem, makes having an object store on-prem very attractive.</description>
